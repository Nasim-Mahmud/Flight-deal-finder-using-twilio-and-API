# Flight-deal-finder-using-twilio-and-API
This is a capstone project in #100DaysOfCode course. It will send a SMS using twilio whenever the flight price of a particular place reduces in a certain threshold.

I have used kiwi flight api, smtplib module for sending emails, sheety api for storing data in google docs.
